# Furniture WebPage
An example of a website for furniture-orientated company, based on a graphic project (check in folder "images" to see the exact photo).

This is my first front-end project. Website provides an automatic slider, which is based on an interval, but it is also 
responsive to 'manual' toggling by user. Furthermore, it includes a 'calculator' section, which 
calculates the price of chair, based on client's choices (such as: fabric, color et cetera).

Technologies used:
* HTML 5
* Sass
* vanilla JS

You can preview the website here:

Enjoy!
